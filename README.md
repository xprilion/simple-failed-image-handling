# Simple Failed Image Handling

This repository demonstrates a minimal example of handling failed image loading using HTML, CSS, and optional JavaScript.

## Core Idea
- Displays a fallback background and message when an image fails to load.
- Uses pure CSS with the `:has()` pseudo-class for modern browser support.
- Includes a JavaScript fallback for broader compatibility.

## Browser Support
- The CSS-only solution requires support for the `:has()` pseudo-class (modern browsers).
- For older browsers, the included JavaScript provides fallback behavior.
